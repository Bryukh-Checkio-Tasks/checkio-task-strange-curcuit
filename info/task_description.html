    <p>Nikola picks up a strange circuit board. He flips it over and examines it closely. All of its elements are
        connected in a spiral and it is possible to connect the neighboring elements vertically and horizontally. He
        decides to play around with the circuit and see what happens.</p>
</div>

<p>
    The map of the circuit consists of a series of square cells. The first element in the center is marked as 1, and
    continuing in a clockwise spiral, each other elements is marked in ascending order
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_infinitum" title="to infinity">ad infinitum</a>. On the map, you can move
    (connect cells) vertically and horizontally. For example, the distance between cells 1 and 9 is two moves and the
    distance between 24 and 9 is one move. You must help Nikola find the distance between any two elements on the map.
